"case4" is derived from the benchmark "IEEE 4 Node Test Feeder" which aiming to test the models of transformers with
different connections.
"case4_D-D_Bload" means the transformer is connected in Delta-Delta with balanced loads.
"case4_Gr.Y-Gr.Y_UnBload" means the transformer is connected in grounded wye-grounded wye with unbalanced loads.
In the "case4_OpenGr.Y-D_Bload", the transformer connection is special which needs modification in iteration.
